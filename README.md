# Vertical-Hydroponics-System #

The Vertical Hydroponics System is an IoT based project which hepls to grow plants without using soil.
Utilising nutritional solutions, plants are grown, and a mobile application is used to Monitor their progress.

# Working #
The sensors are placed at various location In hydroponics frame which records a data. Each sensor has specific threshold, which when crossed will notify the user via application. The user can then monitor and adjust the requirement according to the notification received.
